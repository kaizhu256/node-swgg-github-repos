See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\nThese are the supported media types for commit comments.

GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).\n\nDeployment statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.\n\nBelow is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.\n```\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n| Tooling |             | GitHub |            | 3rd Party |        | Your Server |\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Create Deployment   |                       |                     |\n     |--------------------->|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Deployment Created  |                       |                     |\n     |<---------------------|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Event    |                     |\n     |                      |---------------------->|                     |\n     |                      |                       |     SSH+Deploys     |\n     |                      |                       |-------------------->|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |<----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |   Deploy Completed  |\n     |                      |                       |<--------------------|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |<----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n```\n\nKeep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events.  This allows for [GitHub integrations]() as well as running your own systems depending on your use case. Multiple systems can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your servers, building native code, etc.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\nThe Repo Merging API supports merging branches in a repository. This accomplishes essentially the same thing as merging one branch into another in a local repository and then pushing to GitHub. The benefit is that the merge is done on the server side and a local repository is not needed. This makes it more appropriate for automation and other tools where maintaining local repositories would be cumbersome and inefficient.\n\nIn JSON responses, ```status``` can be one of:\n-  ```null```, which means the site has yet to be built\n-  ```queued```, which means the build has been requested but not yet begun\n-  ```building```, which means the build is in progress\n-  ```built```, which means the site has been built\n-  ```errored```, which indicates an error occurred during the build\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\nComputing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a ```202``` response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.\n\nAs an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.\n\nStatuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint]() to retrieve the whole status for a commit.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

To view the topics property in calls that return repository results, you must provide a custom media type in the Accept header:\napplication/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json\nNote: The Repository Transfer API is currently available for developers to preview.

GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).\nDeployment statuses allow external services to mark deployments with an error, failure, pending, or success state, which can then be consumed by any system listening for deployment_status events.\nDeployment statuses can also include an optional description and target_url, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The target_url would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the description would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.\nDeployments and deployment statuses both have associated repository events when they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is made.\nBelow is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n| Tooling |             | GitHub |            | 3rd Party |        | Your Server |\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Create Deployment   |                       |                     |\n     |--------------------->|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Deployment Created  |                       |                     |\n     |<---------------------|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Event    |                     |\n     |                      |---------------------->|                     |\n     |                      |                       |     SSH+Deploys     |\n     |                      |                       |-------------------->|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |<----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |   Deploy Completed  |\n     |                      |                       |<--------------------|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |<----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\nKeep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers.

Webhooks can be managed using the JSON HTTP API, or the PubSubHubbub API.\nIf you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, check out our API documentation for Organization Webhooks.\nStatistics\nThe Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.\nA word about caching\nComputing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a 202 response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a 200 response with the statistics in the response body.\nRepository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.\nStatistics exclude some types of commits\nThe statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by different repository graphs.\nTo summarize:\n\nStatuses\nThe status API allows external services to mark commits with an error, failure, pending, or success state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.\nStatuses can also include an optional description and target_url, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.\nAs an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The target_url would be the full URL to the build output, and the description would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.\nStatuses can include a context to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ci, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of security.  You can then use the combined status endpoint to retrieve the whole status for a commit.\nNote that the repo:status OAuth scope grants targeted access to statuses without also granting access to repository code, while the repo scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.\nNote: To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the GraphQL node_id in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the blog post for full details. To access node_id during the preview period, you must provide a custom media type in the Accept header:\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\nWarning: The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact GitHub support.\nTraffic\nFor repositories that you have push access to, the traffic API provides access to the information provided in the graphs section.\n\n                                                        https://developer.github.com/v3/index.html#user-agent-required\nAll API requests MUST include a valid User-Agent header.

# [Contents]()

These API methods let you retrieve the contents of files within a repository as Base64 encoded content. See [media types]() for requesting the raw format or rendered HTML (when supported).

Custom media types

[READMEs](), [files](), and [symlinks]() support the following custom media types:
```
application/vnd.github.VERSION.raw
application/vnd.github.VERSION.html
```

# [Deployments]()

Deployments are a request for a specific ref (branch, SHA, tag) to be deployed. GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).

Deployment statuses allow external services to mark deployments with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which can then be consumed by any system listening for ```deployment_status``` events.

Deployment statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.

Deployments and deployment statuses both have associated [repository events]() when they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is made.

Below is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.

Keep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events.  This allows for [GitHub integrations]() as well as running your own systems depending on your use case. Multiple systems can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your servers, building native code, etc.

Note that the ```repo_deployment``` [OAuth scope]() grants targeted access to deployments and deployment statuses **without** granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well.

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json
```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

# [Downloads]()

The Downloads API (described below) was [deprecated on December 11, 2012](). It will be removed at a future date.

We recommend using [Releases]() instead.

The downloads API is for package downloads only. If you want to get source tarballs you should use [this]() instead.

# [Forks]()

no description

# [Merging]()

The Repo Merging API supports merging branches in a repository. This accomplishes essentially the same thing as merging one branch into another in a local repository and then pushing to GitHub. The benefit is that the merge is done on the server side and a local repository is not needed. This makes it more appropriate for automation and other tools where maintaining local repositories would be cumbersome and inefficient.

The authenticated user will be the author of any merges done through this endpoint.

# [Pages]()

The GitHub Pages API retrieves information about your GitHub Pages configuration, and the statuses of your builds. Information about the site and the builds can only be accessed by authenticated owners, even though the websites are public.

In JSON responses, ```status``` can be one of:
-  ```null```, which means the site has yet to be built
-  ```queued```, which means the build has been requested but not yet begun
-  ```building```, which means the build is in progress
-  ```built```, which means the site has been built
-  ```errored```, which indicates an error occurred during the build

# [Releases]()

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json
```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

# [Repository Invitations]()

The Repository Invitations API allows users or external services to invite other users to collaborate on a repo. The invited users (or external services on behalf of invited users) can choose to accept or decline the invitations.

Note that the ```repo:invite``` [OAuth scope]() grants targeted access to invitations **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as invitations.

# [Repository Webhooks]()

The Repository Webhooks API allows repository admins to manage the post-receive hooks for a repository.  Webhooks can be managed using the JSON HTTP API, or the [PubSubHubbub API]().

If you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, check out our [API documentation for Organization Webhooks]().

# [Statistics]()

The Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.

####  A word about caching

Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a ```202``` response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.

Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.

####  Statistics exclude some types of commits

The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs]().

To summarize:
- All statistics exclude merge commits.
- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.

# [Statuses]()

The status API allows external services to mark commits with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.

Statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.

As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.

Statuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint]() to retrieve the whole status for a commit.

Note that the ```repo:status``` [OAuth scope]() grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```]() in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json
```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

# [Traffic]()

For repositories that you have push access to, the traffic API provides access to the information provided in the [graphs section]().

<h1 id="-downloads-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-downloads-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/downloads/">Downloads</a></h1>
<p>The Downloads API (described below) was <a href="https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads">deprecated on December 11, 2012</a>. It will be removed at a future date.</p>
<p>We recommend using <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/">Releases</a> instead.</p>
<p>The downloads API is for package downloads only. If you want to get source tarballs you should use <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#get-archive-link">this</a> instead.</p>

<h1 id="-merging-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-merging-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/merging/">Merging</a></h1>
<p>The Repo Merging API supports merging branches in a repository. This accomplishes essentially the same thing as merging one branch into another in a local repository and then pushing to GitHub. The benefit is that the merge is done on the server side and a local repository is not needed. This makes it more appropriate for automation and other tools where maintaining local repositories would be cumbersome and inefficient.</p>
<p>The authenticated user will be the author of any merges done through this endpoint.</p>
<h1 id="-pages-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-pages-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/">Pages</a></h1>
<p>The GitHub Pages API retrieves information about your GitHub Pages configuration, and the statuses of your builds. Information about the site and the builds can only be accessed by authenticated owners, even though the websites are public.</p>
<p>In JSON responses, <code>status</code> can be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>null</code>, which means the site has yet to be built</li>
<li><code>queued</code>, which means the build has been requested but not yet begun</li>
<li><code>building</code>, which means the build is in progress</li>
<li><code>built</code>, which means the site has been built</li>
<li><code>errored</code>, which indicates an error occurred during the build</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-repository-invitations-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-invitations-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/invitations/">Repository Invitations</a></h1>
<p>The Repository Invitations API allows users or external services to invite other users to collaborate on a repo. The invited users (or external services on behalf of invited users) can choose to accept or decline the invitations.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>repo:invite</code> <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/">OAuth scope</a> grants targeted access to invitations <strong>without</strong> also granting access to repository code, while the <code>repo</code> scope grants permission to code as well as invitations.</p>
<h1 id="-repository-webhooks-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-hooks-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/">Repository Webhooks</a></h1>
<p>The Repository Webhooks API allows repository admins to manage the post-receive hooks for a repository.  Webhooks can be managed using the JSON HTTP API, or the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub API</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, check out our <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/hooks/">API documentation for Organization Webhooks</a>.</p>
<h1 id="-statistics-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-statistics-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/">Statistics</a></h1>
<p>The Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.</p>
<h4 id="a-word-about-caching">A word about caching</h4>
<p>Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a <code>202</code> response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a <code>200</code> response with the statistics in the response body.</p>
<p>Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.</p>
<h4 id="statistics-exclude-some-types-of-commits">Statistics exclude some types of commits</h4>
<p>The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/">different repository graphs</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>All statistics exclude merge commits.</li>
<li>Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="-statuses-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-statuses-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/">Statuses</a></h1>
<p>The status API allows external services to mark commits with an <code>error</code>, <code>failure</code>, <code>pending</code>, or <code>success</code> state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.</p>
<p>Statuses can also include an optional <code>description</code> and <code>target_url</code>, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.</p>
<p>As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The <code>target_url</code> would be the full URL to the build output, and the <code>description</code> would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.</p>
<p>Statuses can include a <code>context</code> to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of <code>ci</code>, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of <code>security</code>.  You can then use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref">combined status endpoint</a> to retrieve the whole status for a commit.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>repo:status</code> <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/">OAuth scope</a> grants targeted access to statuses <strong>without</strong> also granting access to repository code, while the <code>repo</code> scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.</p>

<h1 id="-traffic-https-developer-github-com-v3-repos-traffic-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/traffic/">Traffic</a></h1>

**Note:** Protected Branches API can now manage a setting for requiring signed commits. This feature is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.zzzax-preview+json
```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can use this endpoint to disable required signed commits on a branch. You must enable branch protection to require signed commits.</span>

**Note:** The Protected Branches API now has a setting for requiring a specified number of approving pull request reviews before merging. This feature is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```

```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

Updating pull request review enforcement requires admin or owner permissions to the repository and branch protection to be enabled.</span>

**Note:** The Nested Teams API is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post]() for full details. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.hellcat-preview+json
```

Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with sane defaults.

The ```ref``` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request.

The ```environment``` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as ```production```, ```staging```, and ```qa```. This allows for easy tracking of which environments had deployments requested. The default environment is ```production```.

The ```auto_merge``` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref is behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response.

By default, [commit statuses]() for every submitted context must be in a ```success``` state. The ```required_contexts``` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be ```success```, or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

The ```payload``` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

The ```task``` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be ```deploy:migrations``` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled.

Users with ```repo``` or ```repo_deployment``` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref:</span>

<p>Custom media types are used in the API to let consumers choose the format of the data they wish to receive. This is done by adding one or more of the following types to the <code>Accept</code> header when you make a request. Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently and support formats that other resources don't.</p>
